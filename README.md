+ Here I conduct a brief study on causes of happniess and the differences in the causes of happniess between genders, parenthoods, reflection periods, and categories Basically, this study used some techniques of text mining techniques and natural language processing. The results showed that there are some general causes of happiness, like "friends”, “video games”, “spend time", and "moment life".In addition, there are some differences in the causes of happiness between genders, parenthoods, reflection periods, and categories.I hope this study will help people find the most frequent causes of their happy moments.
